# rawfile-organizer
Organize a giant folder folder of RAW files by their date


## What is the specific use case of this?  
I had a gigantic directory full of raw files I was trying to move to another HDD that had a very particular directory structure
I needed those files to conform to that directory structure.  This made them do that.

for instance, if all of your photos from various date are in `/mnt/disk4/my_raw_files` this script will move them to
`/mnt/disk4/2022-01-01/<FILENAME>`
`/mnt/disk4/2022-01-02/<FILENAME>`
